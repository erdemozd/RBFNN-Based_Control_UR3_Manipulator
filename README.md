# RBFNN-Based_Control_UR3_Manipulator
Implementation of Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) based system identification and control strategies for the UR3 robotic manipulator. Includes model training, trajectory tracking, and adaptive control applications.

Project is implemented using MATLAB and Simulink environment. Use version 2023b

# Following Toolbox' must be installed in order to compile the project:
-Robotic System Toolbox
-Simscape Multibody

UR3 Manipulator used in the project is a mechanical model. In order to visualize the model, mechanic parts must be put in the "UR3 Manipulator" Simulink block. Part names are the same as the .stl files given in "Mechanic Part Models".
